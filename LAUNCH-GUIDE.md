## üìã Form Integration Options

Your forms are ready to collect data, but you need to connect them to a backend. Here are your options:

### **Option 1: FormSpree (Easiest - Recommended)**

**Setup (5 minutes):**
1. Go to https://formspree.io/
2. Sign up for free account
3. Create a new form
4. Copy your form ID

**Implementation:**
Find this code in `index.html` around line 1862:
```javascript
// Example: Send to FormSpree (replace with your endpoint)
const response = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData,
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

Uncomment and replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual FormSpree ID.

**Pricing:** Free for 50 submissions/month, then $10/month for unlimited.

---

### **Option 2: Netlify Forms**

If you deploy to Netlify instead of GitHub Pages:

1. Add `netlify` attribute to your forms:
```html
<form netlify name="intake">
```

2. Netlify automatically handles form submissions

**Pricing:** Free for 100 submissions/month, then $19/month.

---

### **Option 3: Tally Forms (Current)**

Keep using your existing Tally form:

1. In `index.html`, find the submit buttons (search for `#contact`)
2. Change them to link to your Tally form: `https://tally.so/r/wor5LP`

**Note:** This redirects users away from your site. Less ideal for conversion.

---

### **Option 4: Google Sheets + Apps Script**

Free forever, but requires some technical setup:

1. Create a Google Form or Sheet
2. Use Google Apps Script to create a web app endpoint
3. Send form data via POST request

**Tutorial:** https://github.com/jamiewilson/form-to-google-sheets

---

### **Option 5: Custom Backend**

If you have your own server:
1. Create an API endpoint to receive form data
2. Update the fetch URL in the JavaScript
3. Handle email sending, database storage, etc.

---

## üé® Customization Guide

### **Change Colors**

In `index.html`, find the `:root` CSS variables (around line 35):

```css
:root {
  --primary: #6366f1;        /* Main purple */
  --secondary: #8b5cf6;      /* Accent purple */
  --accent: #ec4899;         /* Pink accent */
  /* ... change these to your brand colors */
}
```

### **Change Fonts**

1. Visit Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/
2. Select your fonts
3. Replace the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section
4. Update CSS variables:
```css
--font-body: 'YourFont', sans-serif;
--font-display: 'YourDisplayFont', sans-serif;
```

### **Update Content**

All content is inline in the HTML. Search for sections by ID:
- `#benefits` - Benefits cards
- `#process` - How it works steps
- `#pricing` - Pricing tiers
- `#testimonials` - Customer quotes

### **Add Your Logo**

Replace line 1032 (the nav logo) with:
```html
<img src="your-logo.png" alt="VentureScope" class="nav-logo">
```

Then add CSS:
```css
.nav-logo img {
  height: 40px;
}
```

---

## üìä Analytics Setup (Optional)

### **Google Analytics 4**

1. Create GA4 property at https://analytics.google.com/
2. Get your Measurement ID (looks like `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
3. Add to `<head>` section in `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

The site already has event tracking built-in for:
- CTA button clicks
- Form submissions
- Navigation clicks

---

## üñºÔ∏è Create Social Preview Image

Your site references `social-preview.png` for social media shares. Create one:

**Dimensions:** 1200√ó630px

**Content to include:**
- VentureScope Systems logo/name
- Tagline: "Turn Operational Chaos into Clarity"
- "AI-powered SOPs in 48 hours"
- Website URL
- Brand colors (#6366f1, #8b5cf6)

**Tools:**
- **Canva:** https://www.canva.com/ (Free, easy templates)
- **Figma:** https://www.figma.com/ (Free, professional)
- **Photopea:** https://www.photopea.com/ (Free Photoshop alternative)

**Save as:** `social-preview.png` and add to your repo root.
